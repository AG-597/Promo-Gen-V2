# Promo-Gen-V2
V2 of my original promo gen for getting discord promos through epic games | This one uses Chess.com

kids are selling this shit for over $100 i even saw some kid doing $350 (they are just broke indians)

so here is one, not great but it works (i have confirmed most going for those high prices are selenium based like dis LMAO)

plez share this and make fun of kids selling a barely 150 line program for that much money :(

# info
So this basicly registers on chess.com then makes a request to the promo endpoint for the promo

also it uses selenium cuz i made it in like 10 minutes so it saves promos to promo.txt

plez star and i make fully request version

just run `gen.py` and it starts genning promos
